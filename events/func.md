# Functional Programming

## Invite

Turing Club invites you to the talk "Functional Programming" by Shane D'Mello on this Friday. No previous coding knowledge is essential, but one can appreciate functional programming better if they have some knowledge of OOP. Below are the details

## Abstract

An informal introduction to functional programming, largely via the programming language Haskell and highlighting some features that I have found interesting and useful. The talk will neither be rigorous nor complete but is meant to show some interesting possibilities so that those who are interested can learn more about them from some of the many resources available on the subject.

## About the Speaker

While the speaker works on the Topology of Real Algebraic Varieties, they also are deeply interested in  Programming. Shane Sir has previously taught the course on Theory of Computation, and received the Best Teacher Award last year.
